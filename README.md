# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various machine learning models. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. We have employed five different models for prediction: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Each of these models was trained on the Kaggle dataset, and their performance was evaluated on a separate test dataset. The accuracy scores were calculated for each model, and the results indicated that the K-Nearest Neighbors model achieved the highest accuracy score.

## Background
Heart disease is a critical health issue that affects a significant portion of the global population. Early prediction of heart disease can be valuable for timely medical intervention and prevention. Machine learning techniques offer an avenue to leverage historical data and build predictive models to assist in identifying individuals at risk of heart disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It includes a diverse set of features related to individuals' health and medical indicators that can potentially contribute to heart disease prediction.
The dataset can be downloaded from above.

## Models
We have employed the following machine learning models for heart disease prediction:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
   
Each model was trained on the Kaggle dataset, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize their performance.

## Results
The accuracy scores of the different models on the test dataset are as follows:

 - Logistic Regression: 0.8390243902439024
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM): 0.926829268292683
 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 0.9853658536585366
 - Decision Tree: 0.7213114754098361
 - Random Forest: 0.8032786885245902
   
Out of these models, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model achieved the highest accuracy score, making it the best-performing model for heart disease prediction in this project.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models for heart disease prediction based on the Kaggle dataset. The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model showed the best accuracy among the models tested. Early and accurate prediction of heart disease can play a significant role in improving healthcare outcomes, and the results of this project provide valuable insights into the feasibility of using machine learning for this purpose.
